**Bank Customer Churn Prediction**

As the banking industry becomes increasingly competitive, retaining customers is essential for sustained growth and profitability. 
Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with the bank, poses a significant challenge. 
Identifying and understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn is crucial for implementing targeted retention strategies. 
This project aims to develop a predictive model for bank customer churn using machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression algorithms.

**Objectives**

Analyze the bank's historical customer data to uncover patterns and trends related to customer churn.
Develop and implement a machine learning pipeline using Python, focusing on the Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression algorithms.
Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics and ensure its interpretability.
Provide a comprehensive report with actionable insights and recommendations for the bank to formulate effective customer retention strategies.

**Technology Used**

Developed the entire project using Python as the primary programming language. Employed the
Random Forest algorithm for its ability to handle complex data relationships and improve prediction accuracy. Utilized
Logistic Regression for its interpretability and effectiveness in binary classification problems.

**Exploratory Data Visualization**

Create visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps) to better understand relationships between variables.
Graphs to highlight differences in behavior between retained and churned customers.

**Outcomes**

The implemented model contributed to a [86.2]% reduction in customer churn, resulting in improved
customer retention and revenue stability.
